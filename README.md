Revel is an event management and ticketing platform designed with community at its heart. Initially created to serve the specific needs of queer, LGBTQ+, and sex-positive communities, it is built to be event-agnostic, scalable, and a powerful tool for any group that values privacy, control, and transparency.

Unlike monolithic, corporate platforms that treat events as transactions, Revel treats them as part of a larger community ecosystem.

## ü§î Why Revel? The Philosophy

Revel is being built to address the shortcomings of existing event platforms, especially for communities that prioritize safety, autonomy, and trust.

*   **For Communities, Not Corporations:** Mainstream platforms often have restrictive content policies or a lack of privacy features, creating challenges for adult, queer, or activist-oriented events. Revel is explicitly designed to support these communities.
*   **Open, Transparent & Self-Hostable:** Avoid vendor lock-in. You can host Revel on your own infrastructure for free, giving you complete control over your data and eliminating platform commissions. Its open-source nature means you can trust the code you run.
*   **Fair & Simple Pricing:** For those who choose our future hosted version, the model is simple: **no charge for free events or events where you handle payments yourself**; a **3% + 0.50 cents commission** on paid tickets sold and bought through Revel. This significantly undercuts the high fees of major platforms and helps us keep the platform online, free and open source.

## üöÄ Key Features

Revel combines the ticketing power of platforms like Eventbrite with the community-building tools of Meetup, all under a privacy-minded, open-source framework.

#### Community & Membership
*   **Organizations:** Create and manage your community's central hub. Customize its visibility (Public, Private, Members-Only).
*   **Roles & Permissions:** Assign roles like Owner, Staff, and Member, with a granular permission system to control who can create events, manage members, and more.
*   **Membership System:** Manage a roster of members, enabling members-only events and fostering a sense of belonging.

#### Trust, Safety & Privacy
*   **Advanced Attendee Screening:** Gate event eligibility with custom questionnaires. Automatically review submissions or use a manual/hybrid approach to ensure attendees align with your community's values.
*   **Full Data Ownership:** When self-hosting, you control your data. No third-party trackers, no selling of event data. Keep your community's information safe.
*   **Tailored Invitations:** Send direct invitations that can waive specific requirements (like questionnaires, membership or purchase) for trusted guests.

#### Core Event & Ticketing Features
*   **Event & Series Management:** Easily create single events or recurring event series under your organization.
*   **Ticketing & RSVPs:** Support for both paid/free ticketed events (powered by Stripe) and simpler RSVP-based gatherings.
*   **QR Code Check-In:** Manage event entry smoothly with QR code tickets and a staff-facing check-in flow.
*   **Potluck Coordination:** A unique, built-in system for attendees to coordinate bringing items, moving logistics off messy spreadsheets.

## üèÅ Quick Start (Development)

Get a local development environment running in minutes. You'll need `make`, `Docker`, and Python 3.12+.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/letsrevel/revel-backend.git
    cd revel-backend
    ```
    
2.  **Make sure you have the necessary geo data:**
    *   You must download [IP2LOCATION-LITE-DB5.BIN](https://lite.ip2location.com/database/db5-ip-country-region-city-latitude-longitude?lang=en_US) and place it in `src/geo/data/`
    *   You must download the [worldcities.csv](https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities) and place it in `src/geo/data/` (or for dev purposes just copy `worldcities.mini.csv` into `worldcities.csv`)


3.  **Run the setup command:**
    This command fully automates the setup process.
    ```bash
    make setup
    ```

4.  **You're ready!**
    *   The API is running at `http://localhost:8000`
    *   Interactive API docs (Swagger UI) are at `http://localhost:8000/api/docs`
    *   A default superuser is created (`admin@letsrevel.io` / `password`).

## üìÇ Project Structure

The codebase is organized into a `src` directory with a clear separation of concerns, following modern Django best practices.

*   `src/revel/`: The core Django project settings.
*   `src/accounts/`: User authentication, registration, and profile management.
*   `src/events/`: The core logic for organizations, events, tickets, and memberships.
*   `src/questionnaires/`: The questionnaire building, submission, and evaluation system. [üìñ Read more](src/questionnaires/README.md)
*   `src/geo/`: Geolocation features (cities, IP lookups).
*   `src/telegram/`: Integration with the Telegram Bot API (note: this is a broken early prototype).
*   `src/api/`: Main API configuration, exception handlers, and global endpoints.

Each app contains a `controllers/` directory for API endpoints and a `service/` directory for business logic.
